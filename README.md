# Sudoku
This code is a Python program that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Sudoku solver. 
The GUI is created using the tkinter module. The program creates a 9x9 Sudoku grid using tkinter Entry widgets, where the user can input the initial numbers. 
When the user clicks the "Solve" button, the program uses a solver algorithm from a separate module called "solver" to attempt to solve the Sudoku puzzle. 
If the solver algorithm finds a solution, the solution is displayed in the GUI. If no solution is found, an error message is displayed.

The program also has a "Clear" button that allows the user to clear the input grid. 
Additionally, the program has some validation functions that ensure that the user input is valid, such as checking that the user only inputs numbers or empty strings, and checking that the input is not longer than one character.

The GUI is created using a combination of Tkinter grid and pack geometry managers to arrange the widgets in a grid layout. 
The program also defines two functions, "draw3x3" and "draw9x9", to draw the Sudoku grid. 
Finally, the program defines an "update" function that updates the GUI with the solved Sudoku puzzle, if a solution is found.
